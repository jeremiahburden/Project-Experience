# Biomath Cell Modeling
In this summer research program, I contributed to the understanding of an epithelial cell modeling through the construction of effective trial experiments, the management of a database, and the visualization of model attributes to understand how they are related. In this project, we leveraged the use of Python, Matlab, and Excel in the modeling, visualization, and management of the data.

Included in this repository is our summer's culminating research summary that includes a thorough description of our work, our results, and accompanying visualizations. Due to the sensitivity of the data, the code files are omitted.
