# Biomath Cell Modeling
In this summer research program, I contributed to the understanding of an epithelial cell modeling through the construction of effective trial experiments, the management of a database, and the visualization of model attributes to understand how they are related.

Included in this repository is our summer's culminating research summary that includes a thorough description of our work, our results, and accompanying visualizations. Due to the sensitivity of the data, the code files are omitted.
