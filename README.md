# Prime Trading Development Intern
Over the course of the Summer of 2023, I worked as an Intern with the Development team for Prime Trading LLC. While there, my main project was to develop the backtest of a trade idea, scrape data to leverage Generative AI, and develop an R shiny application.


In this branch, the percentiles.r file presents the visualizations of our backtest. In addition, the distribution of each price by time visualizes the statistical nature of the model. The output visualizations are encapsulated in the image files.

The webscraping.r file depicts the basic webscraping we did. Due to the sensitivity to some of the analysis, the shiny application and the actual use of the webscraping function into the Generative AI are omitted.
