# Producing Volleyball Coaching Reports
As an avid volleyball fan, I have spent extensive time exploring volleyball analytics. I compete as a player and work as a coach, which provides unique data to investigate.
## Coaching
Using Tableau, R, and Excel, I have visualized data to inform staff decision making in various ways.

## Playing
Using R and Excel, I helped identify relative weaknesses in our team using linear regression, leading us to develop a serving study that helped improve our team's serving substantially.
