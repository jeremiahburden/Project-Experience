# Machine Learning Modeling in the NBA
For a semester-long project, my partner and I explored the use of many machine learning models using Python and Weka in a dataset containing performance statistics of NBA players since 1980. The following are the specific models we leveraged:
- exploratory data analysis,
- similarity,
- decision trees,
- k-nearest neighbors,
- clustering,
- anomaly analysis,
- association rules, and
- neural networks.

The attached file describes our culminating paper that includes the variable dictionary, preprocessing, results, and analysis in a formal document.
