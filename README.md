# Machine Learning Modeling in the NBA
For a semester-long project, my partner and I explored the use of many machine learning models (including exploratory data analysis, similarity, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, clustering, anomaly, association rules, and neural networks) using Python in a dataset containing performance statistics of NBA players since 1980.

The attached file describes our culminating paper that includes the variable dictionary, preprocessing, and results in a formal document.
