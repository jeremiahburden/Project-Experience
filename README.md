# Producing Volleyball Coaching Reports
I have spent extensive time exploring volleyball analytics. I compete as a player and work as a coach, which provides many different questions and data to investigate. Using Tableau, R, and Excel, I have visualized data to inform staff decision making in various ways. Using R and Excel, I helped identify relative weaknesses in our team using linear regression, leading us to develop a serving study that helped improve our team's serving substantially.
