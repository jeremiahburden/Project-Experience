# Statistical Consultant for Psychological Research
For a group project working on a semester long project, we worked with a real-world client to gain invaluable experience answering statistical questions for a client researcher.

The following list the questions we sought to answer with the accompanying visualizations and statistical tests:
1. For those who are athletes: Is there a relationship between sport success and athletic identity?
    - Linear Regression on several variables
  - Independent Sample t-Tests
2. For those who are athletes: Is there a relationship between type of sport and athletic identity?
  - ANOVA
3. Are there correlations between the individual indicators of meaning in life (self-esteem, social connectedness, certainty, symbolic immortality) and the direct measurement of the concept?
  - Multiple Linear Regression
4. Is meaning in life in the athletic population most informed by a subset of the four theoretically predicted indicators of meaning in life?
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Best Subsets Variable Selection
  - Neural Networks
